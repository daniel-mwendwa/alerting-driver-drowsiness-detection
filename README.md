# Alerting Driver Drowsiness Detection  
 
A Python-based project to detect drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques and alert them with an audio alarm. The system ensures road safety by monitoring the driverâ€™s facial features in real time.
  
## Features
- Detects drowsiness by monitoring eye aspect ratio (EAR). 
- Detects yawning by calculating the lip distance.
- Alerts the driver with an audio alarm when drowsiness or yawning is detected.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV
- dlib
- imutils
- numpy
- scipy
- pyttsx3
